## Latest Changes

### 2025-01-20: Fixed Actor Generation Prompt (actors_init.py Update)

**Overview:** Updated the `1_initialization_route/actors_init.py` file to generate proper world political influence actors instead of individual people, and improved the logging system with enhanced visual feedback.

**Issue Fixed:** The system was generating individual people (like "Elena Rodriguez", "Wei Chen") instead of world political influence actors (countries, organizations, companies, alliances).

**Key Changes:**
- **Enhanced Logging:** Added `log_success()` function with green checkmark emojis for better visual feedback
- **Improved Display:** Updated terminal output with emojis for better user experience (🔄, 📊, ✅, 📝, 🎯)
- **Better Success Messages:** Comprehensive success logging with detailed information
- **Fixed Documentation:** Updated all file path references from `initialization_route` to `1_initialization_route`
- **Enhanced Cost Integration:** Better integration with the cost tracking system

**Updated Output Format:**
```

### 2025-01-20: Updated Filename Convention from "round" to "level"

**Overview:** Changed the naming convention for all JSON files from "round_X" to "level_X" to better reflect the hierarchical nature of the world model structure.

**Key Changes:**
- **actors_init.py:** Now creates `Features_level_0.json` instead of `Features_round_0.json`
- **actors_leveldown.py:** Now loads `Features_level_0.json` and creates `Features_level_1.json`
- **Function Rename:** `load_features_round_0()` → `load_features_level_0()`
- **Updated Documentation:** All references updated to reflect new naming convention

**New File Structure:**
```
worldmodel/backend/init_logs/
├── run_2025-01-20_1/
│   ├── Features_level_0.json  (Main actors: Countries, Companies, Organizations)
│   └── Features_level_1.json  (Sub-actors within each main actor)
├── run_2025-01-20_2/
│   ├── Features_level_0.json
│   └── Features_level_1.json
└── run_2025-01-20_3/
    ├── Features_level_0.json
    └── Features_level_1.json
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Clearer Hierarchy:** "Level" better represents the hierarchical structure

- **Run Tracking:** Each run gets its own subfolder with automatic incrementing
- **Backward Compatibility:** System automatically finds the most recent run folder
- **Enhanced Metadata:** All JSON files include run folder information

**New Folder Structure:**
```
worldmodel/backend/init_logs/
├── run_2025-01-20_1/
│   ├── Features_level_0.json
│   └── Features_level_1.json
├── run_2025-01-20_2/
│   ├── Features_level_0.json
│   └── Features_level_1.json
└── run_2025-01-20_3/
    ├── Features_level_0.json
    └── Features_level_1.json
```

**Technical Implementation:**

1. **actors_init.py Changes:**
   - Updated `save_actors_to_json()` to create date-based subfolders
   - Automatic run number increment for multiple runs per day
   - Enhanced metadata with run folder information

2. **actors_leveldown.py Changes:**
   - Updated `load_features_round_0()` to find most recent run folder
   - Updated `save_enhanced_actors_to_json()` to use same run folder
   - Enhanced error handling for missing run folders

**Subfolder Naming Convention:**
- Format: `run_YYYY-MM-DD_N` where N is the run number for that day
- Example: `run_2025-01-20_1`, `run_2025-01-20_2`, etc.
- Automatic increment prevents overwrites

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Organized Storage:** Easy to track different runs and experiments
- ✅ **No Overwrites:** Each run preserved in its own folder
- ✅ **Date Organization:** Easy to find runs by date
- ✅ **Hierarchical Consistency:** Level 0 and Level 1 files in same folder
- ✅ **Automatic Detection:** System finds most recent run automatically
- ✅ **Enhanced Metadata:** Full traceability with run folder information

**Example Terminal Output:**
```
